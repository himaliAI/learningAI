We use polynominal regression when the function is not linear
    eg, quadratic equation

Form:
    y = b + w1x + w2x^2 + w3x^3 + ..... + wnx^n # n is the degree

What we basically do?
    For given x,
    first we calculate x, x^2, x^3, ......, x^n 
    Then we apply linear regression with:
        x as x1
        x^2 as x2
        x^3 as x3 and so on
    In short:
        we transform x to various degrees
        then use those x to perform linear regression

What are the concerns?
    1. If we use lesser degrees than optimum,
        it will be a under-fitting curve.
        Means, it does not fit the data properly
    2. If we use higher degrees than optimum,
        it will be over-fitting curve.
        Means, it tries to fit most of the curve but,
            it is due to memory and prediction will be poor.
        There will be a wavy curve.

How do we address our concerns?
    1. We consider up to a high degree, for eg let's say 10
    2. For each degree, we calculate R^2. 
    3. R² score represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features
        Or, simply, R^2 of 0.85 indicate that 85% of the variance in y can be explained by our model
    4. While calculating R^2, we divide our data into 5 bins (cv=5)
        each bin calculates R^2, thus there are 5 R^2
        We calculate mean of R^2 for that degree 
    5. We consider a degree as optimum whose R^2 is highest.

    We will revisit later.

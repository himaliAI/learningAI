Linear regression with scikit-learn

scikit-learn (often written as sklearn) is a popular Python library for Machine Learning.
It provides ready-made functions for:
    Regression (predicting continuous values)
    Classification (predicting categories)
    Clustering (grouping similar data)
    Data preprocessing (scaling, splitting, etc.)
In Linear Regression, scikit-learn does all the math we learned manually â€” it finds the best-fitting line (that minimizes cost) automatically.

# Training the model (means find Theta [b and w1, w2, w3, .... wm])
X -> size(100, 1) # 100 samples, 1 feature
y = 2.5 * X + 1.5 + noise # size (100, 1)

model = LinearRegression() # creates object
model.fit(X, y) # train the model to find intercept_ and coef_
print(f"Intercept (b) = {model.intercept_}")
print(f"Coefficient (w): {model.coef_}")

# Predict with the trained model 
use the b and w (or multiple ws) above to predict y
y = model.predict(x)

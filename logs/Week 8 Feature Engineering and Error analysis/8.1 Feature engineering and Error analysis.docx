Feature Engineering:
    Feature Engineering is the process of creating, transforming, or selecting 
    input variables (features) to improve a machine learning model’s performance

    Good features = better generalization, higher accuracy, and more interpretable models

    Advantages:
        1. Boosts accuracy
        2. Reduce overfitting
        3. Improves interpretability
        4. Domain knowledge: Incorporating human understanding of the problem into the model

Common Feature Engineering techniques:
    1. Transformations:
        Apply mathematical functions to stabilize distribution or highlight relationships
            eg: log(fare) to reduce skew
            eg: age^2 if squared age has predictive power
    
    2. Binning / Discretization:
        Convert continuous variables into categories
            eg: Age groups (child, teenager, adult, senior)
            eg: Income (low, medium, high)

    3. Interaction features:
        Combine two or more features to capture relationships
            eg: sibsp + parch -> family size 
            eg: sex * pclass  -> survival odds differ by gender and class

    4. Encoding categorical variables:
        Convert categories into numbers the model can use:
            eg: One-hot encoding: creates binary columns for each category
            eg: Target encoding: replaces category with average target value
            eg: Frequency encoding: replaces category with its Frequency

    5. Handling missing Data:
        Impute missing values with mean, median, mode, or a special category
        Sometimes missingness itself is informative (eg 'unknown' category)

    6. Scaliing:
        Standardize or normalize numerical features so they're comparable
        Essential for models sensitive to scale (SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression)

    7. Feature Selection
        Remove irrelevant or redundant features
        
        Methods: correlation analysis, Lasso (L1), tree-based importance, permutation importance

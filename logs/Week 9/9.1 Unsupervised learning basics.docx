Unsupervised learning is about finding patterns in data without labelled outcomes
    i.e. no target variable

Common goals of Unsupervised learning:
    Clustering: group similar data points (eg k-means)
    Dimensionality reduction: simplify data while preserving structure (eg PCA)
    Anomaly detection: flag unusual data points (eg, isolation Forest)

Summarize cluster profiles:
    Understand what each cluster represents in terms of original features
    Translate PCA + k-means results back to real-world traits (eg, alcohol level, acidity, color intensity)

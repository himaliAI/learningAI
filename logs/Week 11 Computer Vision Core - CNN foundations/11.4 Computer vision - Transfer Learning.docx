Training deep CNNs from scratch requires massive datasets. 
Medical imaging datasets are often small. 
Transfer learning lets us reuse knowledge from large datasets (like ImageNet) and 
    adapt it to smaller, domain-specific datasets.

How?
    1. Load a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet18, MobileNet).
    2. Freeze early layers (keep their weights fixed).
    3. Replace the final classifier layer with one suited to your dataset 
        (e.g., 10 classes for CIFAR‑10, 2 classes for cats/dogs).
    4. Fine‑tune only the last layers.

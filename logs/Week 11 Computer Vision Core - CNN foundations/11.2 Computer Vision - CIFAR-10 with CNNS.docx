CIFAR-10 images are color images with three channels - RGB

CIFAR-10 CNN code scafold will look similar to MNIST but adapted for RGB and deeper layers.

Differences:
    Input channels: 3 instead of 1 (RGB vs grayscale)
    Deeper network: 3 convolution layers instead of 2
    Image size: CIFAR‑10 is 32×32, so after 3 poolings → 4×4 feature maps
    Fully connected input size: 128 * 4 * 4 = 2048 features.

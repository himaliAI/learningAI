Miniconda3 setup done with PyTorch and TensorFlow

Tensor: generalization of vectors and matrices
    Scalar -> 0D tensor (single number)
    Vector -> 1D tensor
    Matrix -> 2D tensor
    Higher-order tensors -> 3D, 4D, ... (used for images, batches etc)

PyTorch makes use of GPU device with .to(device)
    GPU accelerates processing massively

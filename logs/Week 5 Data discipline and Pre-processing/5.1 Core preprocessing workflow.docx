Core preprocessing workflow steps:
    Dataset loading (In our example, we have loaded from openml)

    Column identification (Identify columns with numerical vs categorical values)

    Pipelines for numeric/categorical preprocessing (define a collection of actions for preprocessing data (impute, scale/onehot) inside one pipeline)

    Train-test split (split original data to training data (80% in our case) and test data(20%))

    Fit/transform with discipline (Apply preprocessing pipelines to training data and test data separately)

    Full pipeline with model (new pipelines with preprocessing + modelling; fit on training data, evaluate on test data)

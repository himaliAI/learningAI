Time based splits
    First we split the given data to first 80% as train data
        and remaining 20% for test data
    
    Then, we apply preprocessing pipeline
    Next, wa apply final pipeline (including model)

    We will train the model in training data
    Then, predict in test data using the learned parameters during training

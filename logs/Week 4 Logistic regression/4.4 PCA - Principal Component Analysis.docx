PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique in ML and AI to
    reduce dimensionality of data wile preserving as much variance (information) as possible

    It transforms original features to a new set of features called Prinicpal Components
    These Principal Components are uncorrelated and ordered by the amount of variance they capture

Why use PCA?
    1. To simplify complex datasets
    2. To visualize high-dimensional data
    3. To speed up learning algorithms
    4. To remove noise and redundancy

PCA is basically a preprosessing step in ML
